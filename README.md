## 👂 What's This All About?

Ever wondered how your favourite apps are built? We're going learn about the fundamental buildings blocks of every web application:

-   𝍌 **HTML**: The language used to structure the page's content
-   👯‍♂️ **CSS**: The language that gives the content 'style' (color, size, font)
-   🏃🏻‍♀️ **JavaScript**: The language that makes the page 'dynamics' (moving, appear, disappear)
